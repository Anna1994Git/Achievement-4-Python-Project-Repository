# 🐍 Instacart Python Data Modeling (Achievement 4)

This repository contains the work completed for **Achievement 4** of the CareerFoundry Data Analytics Program. The focus of this project is to use **Python** for data cleaning, customer profiling, segmentation, and predictive modeling on Instacart customer data. The goal is to support the business team with insights that can help improve customer retention.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Clean and combine multiple large datasets (CSV, Excel, Pickle)
- Create customer profiling variables (e.g., age group, income bracket, number of dependents)
- Segment customers based on behavior and demographics
- Use a **decision tree model** to predict the probability of customer churn
- Recommend targeted strategies to retain high-risk customers

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Dask, scikit-learn
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For cleaning, profiling, and modeling
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn:** For creating visualizations
- **Excel:** For the final project report and decision tree illustration
